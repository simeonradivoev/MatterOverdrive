        <text class="matter-text text-block" style="width:180px">Dilithium is an extremely hard crystalline mineral that occurs naturally on some planets.
            When placed in a high-frequency electromagnetic field, magnetic eddies are induced in its structure which keep charged particles away from the crystal lattice.</text>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">Used by most Matter Overdrive machines. Dilithium can only be procured from [block name=dilithium_ore] by mining it with tool with an iron mining capability or above. Fortune enchantments can increase the amount of crystals, [block name=dilithium_ore] drops.</text>
