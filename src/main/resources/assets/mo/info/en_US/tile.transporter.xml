        <text class="matter-text text-block" style="width:180px">To accomplish that the $itemName requires RF energy based on the distance. It stores the quantum information of each atom and transfers it to a desired location. Every entity directly above the $itemName will be affected by the transportation. This means that multiple subjects can teleport at the same time. The $itemName must also be configured with the destination coordinates.</text>

        <title size="2" class="matter-text small-title">Destination</title>
        <text class="matter-text text-block">The destination consists of 3 values. The X, Y and Z coordinates of the world point. Each coordinate also shows the relative displacement/distance compared to the transporter itself. Each location stored in the transporter can be edited and renamed. Then only the selected location is used as a destination. </text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">By default the $itemName has quite a small range. [item name=upgrade damage=4 guide=upgrades page=4] can be used to boots the range of the $itemName. Each range upgrades stacks up and can add up to quite a large radius.</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">You can also use the [item name=upgrade damage=1 guide=upgrades page=1] and [item name=upgrade damage=2 guide=upgrades page=2] as well as the [item name=upgrade guide=upgrades page=5 damage=5].</text>
