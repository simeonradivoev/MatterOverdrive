        <text class="matter-text text-block">Like most energy weapons the $itemName can be rapidly recharged by [item name=energy_pack],
            overhead if fired continually without stopping and can be upgraded using weapon modules at the [block name=weapon_station].</text>

        <text class="matter-text text-block">The $itemName can also be dropped by Ranged Rogue Androids. There are also Legendary versions of the sniper dropped only by Legendary Rogue Androids.
            The Legendary versions can have increased base stats that can stack with weapon modules.
